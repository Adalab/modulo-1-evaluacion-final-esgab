# Final Module 1 Evaluation Exercise

This exercise assesses the knowledge we have gained throughout Module 1 of the Web Development Bootcamp at [Adalab](https://adalab.es). To complete it, we had to structure a web page with a predetermined design that also had to be responsive to different devices.

The exercise is integrated into the Starter Kit project template provided by Adalab and created in **node and vite**.

What did I use in the exercise?

- HTML
- BEM Naming Convention
- Sass
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Media queries
- CSS Transitions
- CSS Animation
